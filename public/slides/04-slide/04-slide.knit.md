> "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) borrowed $10 billion in the investment-grade corporate debt market on Monday, the Google parentâ€™s largest ever bond issue, which it secured at its lowest-ever cost of financing.

> Of the $10 billion on offer, the $1 billion five-year tranche was issued at a coupon of 0.45%, the lowest coupon seen on a U.S. corporate bond at that maturity, according to Refinitiv data, which goes back to 1980."

# Bond

.pull-left[.large[
**Bond** is a security sold by a government or a corporation to raise money from investors in exchange for a promised future payment.

<br><br>

Examples: T-Bills, T-Notes, T-Bonds, Commercial Paper, Corporate Bonds, Municipal Bonds, Mortgage-backed Securities, Asset-backed Securities, etc.

# Bonds: Terminology

.large[
Maturity (n): The final repayment date of a bond.

Coupon payment (**CPN**): The promised interest payments of a bond, paid periodically until maturity.

Face Value (**FV**) / Par value / Principal value: The notional amount of the bond used to compute the interest. The face value is typically repaid at maturity.

Yield to Maturity (**YTM**): The **YTM** is the Return on Investment (**ROI**) in a bond that is held to its maturity date. It is essentially the **IRR** taking considerations of the current market price of the bond and the future cash flows of the bond.

Coupon rate: The sum of all coupon payments in 1 year divided by the face value of the bond.

# Bond: Example

.large[
A bond with par value $1,000 with 8% coupon and semi-annual payments, maturing in 5 years.

This means that:
]

- $1,000 x 8% = $80 coupon payment per year.

- Since coupons are paid semi-annually, $80 / 2 = $40 will be paid every 6 months as coupon payments.

- $1,000 face value will be repaid at year 5.

# Bond Price

.large[
How to Price bonds?

Treat it as a Time Value of Money (TVM) problem!

# Zero-Coupon Bond

.large[
A zero-coupon bond pays only the face value at maturity.

Recall the TVM formula:

$$
FV_t = PV\times(1+r)^t
$$
]

where FV<sub>t</sub> is future value at year t, PV is present value, r is interest rate.

Translating to "Bond language", a zero-coupon bond would have the following formula:
.pull-left[
$$
FV = P\times(1+YTM_n)^n\qquad \text{or}
$$
]
.pull-right[
$$
P = \frac{FV}{(1+YTM_n)^n}
$$
]

where FV is face value, P is price, YTM<sub>n</sub> is yield-to-maturity (as the effective rate per period), n is time to maturity (in terms of no. of compounding periods).

Note: n is the year to maturity and YTM<sub>n</sub> is the EAR only when the the interest is compounded annually.

# Zero-coupon Bond: Example

What is the market price of a zero-coupon bond with face value $50,000, 25 years to maturity, and 6% YTM?

# Zero-coupon Bond: Example

.large[
What is the market price of a zero-coupon bond with face value $50,000, 25 years to maturity, and 6% YTM?

Answer:

\begin{split}
P &= \frac{FV}{(1+YTM_n)^n}\\
&= \frac{50,000}{(1+0.06)^{25}}\\
&= \$11,655
\end{split}
]
---

# Coupon Bond

.large[
A coupon bond can be considered as 2 separate cash flows:

1. An annuity of coupon payments

2. A zero-coupon bond that repays the face value at maturity.

Combining these two cash flows, we get the formula for pricing a coupon bond:

$$
P = \frac{CPN}{YTM_n}\bigg[1 - \frac{1}{(1+YTM_n)^n}\bigg]+\frac{FV}{(1+YTM_n)^n}
$$
The first term is the annuity portion of the coupon, and the second term is the zero-coupon bond portion.
]

Note: You have to use YTM<sub>n</sub> and n corresponding to the coupon payment intervals. e.g. If coupon is paid<br>semi-annually, $n = \text{year-to-maturity}\times 2$, YTM<sub>n</sub> is the effective rate over 6 months.

# Coupon bond: Example

.large[
A bond with $1,000 par value, 5 years to maturity, 5% coupon rate paid semi-annually. If the bond has YTM of 6% (APR compounded semi-annually), what is the price of the bond?

# Coupon bond: Example

.large[
A bond with $1,000 par value, 5 years to maturity, 5% coupon rate paid semi-annually. If the bond has YTM of 6% (APR compounded semi-annually), what is the price of the bond?

$$
FV = \$1,000
$$
$$
CPN = \frac{5\% \times \$1,000}{2} = \$25 \quad\text{every 6 months}
$$
$$
n = 5 \times 2 = 10 \quad\text{semi-annual periods}
$$
$$
YTM_{10} = 6\%/2 = 3\% \quad \text{effective semi-annual rate}
$$
]

# Coupon bond: Example cont'd

.large[
Use the coupon bond formula:

\begin{split}
P &= \frac{CPN}{YTM_n}\bigg[1 - \frac{1}{(1+YTM_n)^n}\bigg]+\frac{FV}{(1+YTM_n)^n}\\
&= \frac{25}{0.03}\bigg[1 - \frac{1}{(1+0.03)^{10}}\bigg]+\frac{FV}{(1+0.03)^{10}}\\
&= \$957.35
\end{split}
]

# Solving for YTM

.large[
How to solve for YTM?

- For zero-coupon bonds, just solve it by rearranging the equation:

\begin{split}
&FV = P\times(1+YTM_n)^n\\
\Rightarrow \quad &YTM_n = \bigg(\frac{FV}{P}\bigg)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1
\end{split}

- For coupon bonds, solve it the same way you solve for IRR:

$$
\frac{CPN}{YTM_n}\bigg[1 - \frac{1}{(1+YTM_n)^n}\bigg]+\frac{FV}{(1+YTM_n)^n} - P = 0
$$
]
Note: For coupon bonds, you might need to use tools such as excel to calculate the YTM<sub>n</sub>.

# Solving for YTM: Example

.large[
A coupon bond has a FV of $1,000, with 5 years to maturity. The coupon rate is 10% paid semi-annually. The current price of the bond is $859.52. What is the YTM (in terms of APR with semi-annual compounding)?

# Solving for YTM: Example

.large[
A coupon bond has a FV of $1,000, with 5 years to maturity. The coupon rate is 10% paid semi-annually. The current price of the bond is $859.52. What is the YTM (in terms of APR with semi-annual compounding)?

YTM:
\begin{equation}
\frac{1,000 \times 0.1 /2}{YTM_{10}}\times\bigg[1-\frac{1}{(1+YTM_{10})^{10}}\bigg]+\frac{1,000}{(1+YTM_{10})^{10}}-859.92 = 0
\end{equation}
$$
YTM_{10} = 7\%
$$
Convert to APR:

$$
YTM_{APR} = 7\% \times 2 = 14\%
$$

# Holding Period Return (HPR)
.large[
What if you sell a bond before it matures?

Consider the following example:

- You bought a coupon bond that matures sometime in the future. And after n years (before the bond matures), you decide to sell the bond at market price.

- Your cash flow consists of:
  - Buying the bond (initial investment, P<sub>0</sub>)
  - Coupon payments received while holding the bond. (CPN<sub>1</sub>, CPN<sub>2</sub>, ... , CPN<sub>n</sub>)
  - Selling price of the bond. (P<sub>n</sub>)

\begin{equation}
HPR = \frac{P_n - P_0 + \sum_{t=1}^n CPN_t}{P_0}
\end{equation}
]
---

# HPR: Example
.large[
- Suppose you buy a Government of Canada bond for $1,170.60.  The bond has a $1,000 face value, a 5% annual coupon and a 3% YTM and matures in 10 years.

- One year later, you sell the bond when the YTM was 2%. What is your holding period return?

# HPR: Example
.large[
Find the selling price of the bond at year 1:

We can consider this as a new bond that has FV of $1,000, **9** years to maturity, 5% annual coupon, and 2% YTM and calculate the fair price at year 1.

\begin{split}
P &= \frac{1,000 \times 0.05}{0.02}\times\bigg[1-\frac{1}{(1+0.02)^9}\bigg] + \frac{1,000}{(1+0.02)^9}//
&= \$1,244.87
\end{split}
