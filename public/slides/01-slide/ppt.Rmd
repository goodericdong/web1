Different ways of categorizing markets.

Today we will focus on the stock market mostly.


---

![](stockmarket.png)

---


Primary market
===================

- .large[A market where securities/stocks are created by the firm and sold to investors.]


- .large[Examples:]
  - IPO (Initial public offering)
  - Rights offering
  - Private placement
  - Preferential allotment

???
Rights offering: firms that are already in the secondary market raising additional capital by issuing more shares and current shareholders have the rights to purchase such shares first.

Private placement: Directly issue and sell shares to a private entities such as hedge funds or banks.

Preferential allotment: Offering shares to investors (hedge funds, banks again) at an exclusive discounted price which is not available to the public.

---

Secondary Market
===================
- .large[A market where shareholders/investors trade with each other on the outstanding shares of firms.]


- .large[Types of secondary market depends on the trading mechanism]
  - Auction market/Organized exchange: Everyone get together and declare their price and trade accordingly.
  - Dealer market: Dealers have inventory of stocks and trade to both buyers and sellers and earn profit through the spread.
  - OTC, third and fourth markets

---

Auction market / Organized exchange
===================
- .large[NYSE]
- .large[Specialists: Focusing on one or several stocks, and maintain a book of all unexecuted orders and decide the bid-ask prices.]
  - .med[Act as both broker and dealer]
      - Broker: execute the buy/sell order on behalf of clients
      - Dealer: trade on their own account and inventories
  - .med[Specialist can reduce the bid-ask spread in their discretion.]
      - Example:
          - highest unexecuted bid: $10
          - Lowest unexecuted ask: $12
          - A specialist can offer bid at $11 and ask at $11.05 such that the spread is reduced to a more reasonable level.


---


Dealer market
===================
- .large[Nasdaq]


- .large[No specialist but dealers/market makers exist to provide liquidity]


- .large[Difference between dealer and auction market]
  - .med[No central location needed]
  - .med[Negotiated market]
  - .med[Can have more than 1 dealer per stock]

---

.exl[Over-the-counter markets]
- .large[Used to mean the same thing as dealer market]
- .large[Now primarily used to refer to stocks that are not listed on NYSE, Nasdaq and AMEX, e.g. OTCBB, OTC Markets Group.]

.exl[Third market]
- .large[OTC transaction on listed stocks]

.exl[Fourth market]
- .large[Large institutions trading directly without brokers]

Limit Order Markets
=====================

- Limit order markets provide two basic order types
  - .blue[Market orders:] "A market order is an instruction to trade at the best price currently available in the market"(Harris 2003, p. 71)
  - .blue[Limit orders:] "A limit order is an instruction to trade at the best price available, but only if it is no worse than the limit price specified by the trader" (Harris 2003, p. 73)


- Terms:
  - .blue[Bid:] bid price is the price at which a trader is willing to buy securities
  - .blue[Best bid:] best bid is the highest bid price in a market
  - .blue[Ask:] ask price is the price at which a trader is willing to sell securities
  - .blue[Best ask:] best ask is the lowest ask price in a market

.center[.grass[.little["The bid-ask spread is the price impatient traders pay for immediacy"]] .small[(Harris 2003, 297)]]

.center[.border1[.med[
$$\text{Quoted Spread}_{i,t} =  (\text{Ask}_{i,t} - \text{Bid}_{i,t})/(2*\text{Mid}_{i,t})$$ ]]]

- .large[The .blue[half quoted spread] is calculated relative to the stock price and results are usually reported in basis points (bps) in academic literature]
  - .med[Basis points: 1 bp = 1 / 10000 = 1% / 100]
  - .med[In practice spreads are usually reported in cents/pennies.]

---

- .large[.blue[Large orders] sweep the book such that the average spread paid for a trade is higher than the quoted spread]

The Power of Electronic Limit Order Book
==========================================

- .large[Glosten (1994) Journal of Finance]
- .large[Theoretical paper discussing the effectiveness of electronic limit order book.]
.center[ in the determination of offers(bids).
.highlight[While exhibiting a small-trade spread, the open limit order book provides environments. The article suggests that if there is a large population of potential liquidity suppliers, and if the actual costs of running an exchange are small, then among exchanges that operate continuously and anonymously, and supply nice marginal price schedules, the electronic exchange is the only one that does not tend to engender additional competing exchanges.]]

- .large[Conclusion: an exchange with electronic limit order book theoretically outcompetes other exchanges in terms of liquidity provided.]
