# Pension Funds
.large[
HOOPP is a pension fund.

- It manages assets and use the profits from the investments to pay the retirees enrolled in their pension fund programs.

- In order to fulfill the obligations, it has to manage its investments such that both the expected return and the risk need to be maintained at an appropriate level.

- It is expected that a pension fund is less willing to take risks comparing to an average firm.

- But most investments are risky in nature. How to reduce the risk of HOOPP's investments in the insurance industry?

# Risk Management through Hedging
.large[
*Hegding* is a way to reduce risk of adverse price movements in an asset, by taking offsetting position in a related security.

Examples of hedging:
]

- Buying house insurance: Owning a house exposes you to risk of losing the house due to fires, break-ins, other natural disasters, etc. You can hedge by buying house insurance, which pays you when those disasters happen.

- Buying options: Owning a stock exposes you to the risk of stock price going down. You can hedge this risk by purchasing a put option.

- Example in the case: Since HOOPP pays retirees monthly income for the remainder of their lives, HOOPP is exposed to the risk of increasing average longetivity which would result in more obligations. Selling life insurance policies would offset this risk since increasing longetivity would result in higher insurance premium received.

Overall, hedging would reduce the amount of loss for unsuccessful investments, but it comes at the price of reduced profit when the investment is successful.
