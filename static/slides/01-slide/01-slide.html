# One-Period Future Value

.large[
If you were to invest $10,000 at 5% interest for one year, how much would you have at the end of the year?
]
---

# One-Period Future Value

.large[
If you were to invest $10,000 at 5% interest rate for one year, your investment would grow to **$10,500**.

$10,000 is the principal repayment

$500 would be interest: $10,000 `\(\times\)` 0.05

$10,500 is the total due. It can be calculated as:

$$
\$10,500 = \$10,000 \times (1+0.05)
$$

The total amount due at the end of the investment is called the **Future Value (FV)**. What is the formula for **FV**?

$$
FV = PV(1+r)
$$

# One-Period Present Value

If you were promised $10,000, due in one year, when interest rate is 5%. How much would your investment be worth today?

# One-Period Present Value

.large[
If you were promised $10,000, *due in one year*, when interest rate is 5%, your investment would worth $9,523.81 in *today's dollars*.

$$
\frac{\$ 10,000}{1+0.05} = \$9,523.81
$$

The amount that a borrower would need to set aside today to be able to meet the promised payment of $10,000 in one year is called the **Present Value (PV)** of $10,000. What is the formula for **PV**?

$$
PV = \frac{FV}{1+r}
$$
]
---

# Net Present Value (NPV)

.large[
- The **Net Present Value (NPV)** of an investment is the present value of the expected (future) cash flows, less the cost of the investment.

$$
NPV = -\text{investment} + \frac{CF}{1+r} &gt; 0
$$

- Q: Suppose an investment that promises to pay $10,000 in one year is offered for sale for $9,500. Your interest rate is 5%. Should you invest?

# Net Present Value (NPV)

.large[

Q: Suppose an investment that promises to pay $10,000 in one year is offered for sale for $9,500. Your interest rate is 5%. Should you invest?

$$
NPV = -\$9,500 + \frac{\$10,000}{1+0.05} = \$23.81 &gt; 0
$$

A: Yes!

**Note**: "Your interest rate" is your **required rate of return**, it is possible that different individuals/entities will have **different** required rates of return.

# Multiperiod Future Value

# Multiperiod Future Value

You have $100 to invest in a bank account that pays an interest rate `\(r = 6 \%\)` per year, compounding annually.

- Future value of investment in year 1:

$$
FV_1 = \$100 \times (1+0.06) = \$106
$$

- Future value of investment in year 2:

$$
FV_2 = FV_1 \times (1+0.06) = \$106 \times 1.06 = \$112.36

# Exercise: Solve for number of periods
.large[

If we deposit $5,000 today in an account paying 10% interest rate, compounding annually. How long does it take to double our money?

]
---
# Formula Setup

.large[
Recall the Present Value formula:

$$
PV = \frac{FV_t}{(1+r)^t}
$$

We can rearrange the formula to solve for t:

`\begin{split}
  &amp;(1+r)^t = \frac{FV_t}{PV} \\
  \Rightarrow \quad &amp;t\text{ log}(1+r) = \text{log}(\frac{FV_t}{PV})\\
  \Rightarrow \quad &amp;t = \frac{\text{log}(\frac{FV_t}{PV})}{\text{log}(1+r)}
\end{split}`
]
---
# Answer

.large[
Using the derived formula for t, we can get:

`\begin{split}
t &amp;= \frac{\text{log}(\$10,000/\$5,000)}{\text{log}(1+0.1)}\\
&amp;= \text{log }2 / \text{log }1.1\\
&amp;= 7.27 \text{ years}
\end{split}`

**Fun fact**: &lt;br&gt;
Compare the answer to the well known [*Rule-of-72*](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/ruleof72.asp), which states that:

$$
\text{Years to double} \approx \frac{72}{\text{Interest Rate}}

# Real Life Example: Solve for Interest Rate

.large[
In 1626, Dutch Settlers who were representatives of the West India Company, which was publicly traded at the time, purchased the Island Manhattes from the Indians for a value of 60 guilders (equivalent to $24 USD in 1626). 

According to Bloomberg, commercial and residential properties in Manhattan were worth roughly $483.6 billion. 

What was the rate of return on this purchase?

# Formula Setup

.large[
Recall the Present Value formula:

$$
PV = \frac{FV_t}{(1+r)^t}
$$

We can rearrange the formula to solve for r:

`\begin{split}
&amp;(1+r)^t = \frac{FV_t}{PV}\\
\Rightarrow \quad &amp;1+r = \Big(\frac{FV_t}{PV}\Big)^{\frac{1}{t}}\\
\Rightarrow \quad &amp;r = \Big(\frac{FV_t}{PV}\Big)^{\frac{1}{t}}-1
\end{split}`
]
---

# Answer

.large[
Using the derived formula for t, we can get:

`\begin{split}
r &amp;= \Big(\frac{FV_t}{PV}\Big)^{\frac{1}{t}}-1\\
&amp;= \Big(\frac{\$483,600,000,000}{\$24}\Big)^{\frac{1}{2018-1626}}-1\\

# APR vs EAR

.large[
Until now we have been assuming that interest is compounded annually. But what if interests are compounded more (or less) frequently? 
]

- .large[**Annual Percentage Rate (APR)** is the stated or quoted annual interest rate without compounding.]

  - e.g. An APR of 12% compounding quarterly means that it will pay 3% per quarter. The interest will then compound every 3 months (4 times per year).
  
  - $1 investment in a 12% APR with quarterly compounding would be worth `\((1+0.03)^4 = 1.1255\)` next year.

- .large[**Effective Annual Rate (EAR)** is the interest rate that is annualized using compound interest.]

  - e.g. In the example above, the EAR is 12.55%.
  
---

# APR vs EAR (conversion)

.large[We can convert between APR and EAR using the following formula:

`\begin{split}
&amp;(1+EAR)^t = (1+\frac{r}{m})^{mt}\\
\Rightarrow \quad &amp;(1+EAR) = (1+\frac{r}{m})^m
\end{split}`

Where:

  - r = Nominal interest rate per year (APR)
  
  - m = Number of compounding periods per year 
  
    - m = 2 if semi-annual, m = 4 if quarterly, m = 12 if monthly, etc.]

# APR vs EAR Exercise

.large[
If you invest $500 for 5 years at 12% APR compounded semi-annually, what will be the future value of your investment be?

- What is the effective annual rate of this investment?
]

---
# APR vs EAR Answer

`\begin{split}
  FV_5 &amp;= PV \times (1+\frac{r}{m})^{mt}\\
  &amp;= 500 \times (1+\frac{0.12}{2})^{2\times 5}\\
  &amp;= 500 \times 1.06^{10}\\
  &amp;= 895.42
\end{split}`

.large[The investment will be worth $895.42 after 5 years.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

`\begin{split}
  EAR &amp;= (1+\frac{r}{m})^m -1\\
  &amp;= 1.06^2 - 1\\
  &amp;= 12.36\%
\end{split}`

.large[The effective annual rate is 12.36%.]

---
# Continuous Compounding

.large[
The general formula for the future value of an investment compounded continuously over t years can be written as:

$$
FV_t = PV \times e^{rt}
$$
Where:
]
  - PV is the present value of the cash flow at time 0.
  
  - r is the APR.
  
  - t is the number of years over which the cash is invested.
  
  - e is Euler's number ( `\(e \approx 2.718\)` ). `\(e^x\)` is the exponential function and also a key on your calculator. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

# Tips for Solving Time Value of Money Problems


- .large[Draw a timeline that precisely identifies when cash flows occur.]

- .large[Find an anchor - either the present value or future value of the cash flow stream.]

- .large[Make sure that your discount rate matches the compounding and payment frequencies.]

  - Do not confuse APR with EAR
  
  - Maintain consistency between the interest rate and the number of periods.

- .large[
Be careful: The perpetuity and annuity formulas assume that the first payment occurs at time `\(t = 1\)`.

# Example: More Complicated Cash Flows

.large[
You are planning to buy a property. You think that you can sell it in six years for $4,000,000. You also expect to earn rent of $200,000 per year for the first 3 years (starting at the end of this year), and $250,000 for the following 3 years. The interest rate is 8%. How much would you be willing to pay for it today?

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Hint: you can value any complicated stream of cash flows by splitting that stream into separate cash flows, annuities, and/or perpetuities.
]

# Answer

.large[First, draw a timeline for the cash flows:]
![](06-example.png)

.large[
The brute force way (Sum up the PV of each cash flow):
]

`\begin{split}
PV = &amp;\frac{200,000}{(1+0.08)} + \frac{200,000}{(1+0.08)^2} + \frac{200,000}{(1+0.08)^3} + \frac{250,000}{(1+0.08)^4}\\
&amp;+ \frac{250,000}{(1+0.08)^5} + \frac{4,250,000}{(1+0.08)^6}
\end{split}`

---

# Answer (cont'd)

.large[
Or, we can break down the cash flows into:

1. An annuity from year 1 to 3 for $200,000 each year.

2. An annuity from year 4 to 6 for $250,000 each year.

3. A cash flow of $4,000,000 in year 6.
]

`\begin{split}
PV = &amp;\frac{200,000}{0.08}\bigg[1-\frac{1}{(1+0.08)^3}\bigg] + \frac{250,000}{0.08}\bigg[1-\frac{1}{(1+0.08)^3}\bigg]\bigg[\frac{1}{(1+0.08)^3}\bigg] \\
&amp;+ \frac{4,000,000}{(1+0.08)^6}
\end{split}`

.large[
Both methods should yield the same result: $$ PV = \$ 3,547,544 $$
