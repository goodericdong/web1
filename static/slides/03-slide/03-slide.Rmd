As satirical as the comic is, the guy was doing a great job as a finance advisor, since he was able to figure out the cost of building the IT system. (Without knowing anything about it!)

# Capital Budgeting

.large[
In order to calculate the NPV of a project, firm needs to know:

- Initial investment
  - Cost of machinery
  - Set up costs
  - etc.

- Future revenues and expenses
  - Wage
  - Rent
  - Machinery maintenance
  - etc.

# Free Cash Flow (FCF)

.large[
Free cash flow (**FCF**) is the net cash inflow from a firm's operation less capital expenditures (CAPEX).
  - FCF takes initial investment, revenue, expenses, etc. i.e. Every cash flow related to a project into account.

The NPV equation of an N-year project (based on FCF):
$$
NPV = \sum_{t=0}^N\frac{FCF_t}{(1+r)^t}
$$
How to calculate **FCF**?

EBITDA: Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.

# Problem 1: Interest Expenses

.large[
Since we are interested in the **FCF**, which is the cash flow generated by the project to both equity and debt holders. We should exclude the interest expenses.

Instead of net income (**NI**), we calculate the *unlevered net income*, which is the net income assuming there were no debt.
]
$$
\text{Unlevered NI} = EBIT \times (1-T_C)
$$

Where $T_C$ is the corporate tax rate.

.large[
Another way of calculating unlevered net income is to add back the interest expense (post-tax) to the net income (NI):
]
$$
\text{Unlevered NI} = NI + \text{Interest Expense}\times (1-T_C)
$$
---
# Problem 2: Depreciation

.large[
Since depreciation is not a cash expense (i.e. There is no cash transactions as you write-off the depreciation expense), we need to add it to the unlevered net income. This value is the Operating Cash Flow (**OCF**):
]
$$
OCF = \text{Unlevered NI} + Dep
$$
.large[
On the other hand, we can calculate OCF by taxing on the EBITDA (i.e. assuming no debt and no depreciation). However, depreciation generates a tax shield which is a cash inflow. Summing these two items together is another way of calculating **OCF**:
]
$$
OCF = EBITDA\times(1-T_C) + Dep\times T_C
$$
On the right-hand side of the equation, the first item is the post-tax EBITDA, the second item is the depreciation tax shield.
---

# Problem 3: Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)

.large[
**CAPEX**(Sometimes written as CapEX, CAPX) is a cash outflow of purchasing assets. (e.g. land, machinery, etc.) This cash outflow is not recorded in the income statement.

Therefore, when calculating **FCF**, we need to deduct **CAPEX** from the **OCF**.
]

### Problem 4: Change in Net Working Capital ( $\Delta\text{NWC}$ )

.large[
Net working capital is the assets or capital tied up with a specific project:
  - e.g. Cash, inventory, receivables and payables.
]
  
\begin{split}
NWC &= \text{Current Assets} - \text{Current Liabilities}\\
&= \text{Cash} + \text{Inventory} + \text{Receivables} - \text{Payables}
\end{split}

.large[
The change in net working capital is a cash item that is not recorded in the income statement, therefore we need to adjust for it by subtracting it from the OCF.
]

.large[
The change in net working capital ( $\Delta\text{NWC}$ ) is the difference of NWC between year t and t-1:
]

\begin{equation}
\Delta NWC = NWC_{t} - NWC_{t-1}
\end{equation}

---

# Finally, a formula for FCF

$$
FCF = \text{Unlevered NI} + Dep - CAPEX - \Delta NWC
$$

Wait, there is more:

<br><br>

$$
FCF = EBIT \times (1-T_C) + Dep - CAPEX - \Delta NWC
$$
<br><br>

$$
FCF = EBITDA \times (1-T_C) + Dep \times T_C - CAPEX - \Delta NWC
$$
<br><br>

$$
FCF = NI + \text{Interest Expenses} \times (1-T_C) + Dep - CAPEX - \Delta NWC
$$
<br><br>
Use whichever formula that is the most convenient based on the information given.

# Exercise: FCF

.large[Find the FCF of year 2019:]

```{r, echo = F, out.width = "50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("02-FCF.png")
```

---

# Solution

$$
NWC_{2018} = 200+250-150+250 =550
$$
<br><br>

$$
NWC_{2019} = 150 + 300 - 120 + 300 = 630
$$

<br><br>

$$
\Delta NWC = 630 - 550 = 80
$$

<br><br>

\begin{split}
FCF &= EBITDA \times (1-T_C) + Dep\times T_C - CAPEX - \Delta NWC\\
&= (\text{Sales - COGS}) \times (1-T_C) + Dep\times T_C - CAPEX - \Delta NWC\\
&= (5500 - 4700) \times (1-0.4) + 160 \times 0.4 - 250 - 80\\
&= 214
\end{split}

# Further Considerations

- .large[Cannibalism]
  - Introduction of new product that **cannibalizes** revenue of an existing product. (Cash outflow)

- .large[Synergies]
  - Introduction of new product that **boosts** revenue of an existing product. (Cash inflow)
  
- .large[Discount rates]
  - Cash flows must be discounted at appropriate discount rates when calculating NPV.
  
- .large[Sunk costs]
  - Expenses or costs that have already been spent are sunk costs, do **NOT** consider them as cash outflows!
