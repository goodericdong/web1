  - Borrowers and lenders
  - Investors and firms
  - Investors and innovators
  - ...

--

- The financial system's role is to allocate these funds in the most efficient way possible
  - From those that seek/prefer risk to those that eschew risk
  - From this with capital and patience to those without
  - From this without ideas to those with ideas

- Finance is largely about decision making using a quantitative lens, from multiple perspectives.

# Decision making in a Finance world

.large[
- The most important job of a financial manager is to make a firm's investment decisions.

- These decisions require the evaluation of costs and benefits.

  - Managers must justify to shareholders that these investments are good uses of their money.

# Financing Decisions

.large[
- How do we pay for it?:

  - Large investments may require the corporation to raise additional cash.
    - Opportunity costs?
  
  - Do we raise money by issuing shares?
  
  - Or borrow money by issuing debt?
  
  - Or do we use retained earnings?
  
- These decisions determine the capital structure (debt and equity mix of a firm).]
---

# Cash Management (liquidity)

.large[
- The firm needs to have enough cash on hand to meet its daily obligations.

- A firm typically burns through a significant amount of cash developing a new product before its sales can generate income.

- The decision here is to prevent firm's operation being hindered due to a lack of cash.

# Breakout Activity

.large[
- Take some time to consider the the following questions and return with discussions:

1. If you have a large capital investment where retained earnings or cash on hand cannot cover the cost and you need to raise the money externally, how would you raise this money? Why?
  
2. What are the pros and cons of this action? Are there associated risks? For whom?

3. How would this impact the financial market? For instance, would your stock value move up or down?
