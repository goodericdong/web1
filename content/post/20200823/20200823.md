I was notified by a student that the numbers in CCA example 2 (slide 26-27) were wrong.

Below are the corrections:

slide 26: PV of 3 year annuity income from operating should be 83,759 instead of 55,719

slide 27: PV of tax shield should be 26,317 instead of 83,579

slide 28 was correct.

I have updated the slides and the newest versions should have the correct numbers.

NOTE: the formulas were correct and if you put in the numbers in the formula you should be able to get the correct number.
